# Gaming Optimisation Guide

Get the competitive edge with your Olilo fibre connection.

## Quick Wins

1. **Use Ethernet** - Always use a wired connection for gaming. WiFi adds 5-10ms latency.
2. **Enable QoS** - Log in to your router and prioritise gaming traffic in Quality of Service settings.
3. **Close background apps** - Stop downloads, streaming, and cloud syncing whilst gaming.
4. **Use 5 GHz WiFi** - If you must use wireless, stick to 5 GHz band only.

## Port Forwarding

Some games need specific ports open. Common ones:

- **PlayStation:** TCP 80, 443, 3478-3480 / UDP 3478-3479
- **Xbox:** TCP 3074 / UDP 88, 500, 3074, 3544, 4500
- **Steam:** TCP 27015-27030 / UDP 4380, 27000-27031
- **Epic Games:** TCP/UDP 80, 443, 5222, 5795-5847

Enable UPnP in your router for automatic port configuration.

## Latency Guide

- **Under 20ms:** Excellent
- **20-50ms:** Good
- **50-100ms:** Playable
- **Over 100ms:** Noticeable lag
