# Understanding Your CityFibre ONT

Your ONT (Optical Network Terminal) is the bridge between the fibre network and your home.

## What Does It Do?

The ONT converts the light signals from the fibre network into standard ethernet that your router can use. It's a small box an engineer installed where the fibre enters your property.

## Where to Find It

Common locations:
- Utility cupboard
- Living Room
- Hallway
- Home office

The ONT needs mains power 24/7 to work.

## Understanding the Lights

Your ONT has 4 indicator lights that tell you what's happening.

### Power

**Solid/Flashing Green**
- ONT is starting up or running normally
- Check the next light down

**Amber (Flashing or Solid)**
- Firmware update in progress
- Takes 5-10 minutes
- Don't touch anything during this time

**Red**
- Boot failure detected
- Try unplugging for 10 seconds
- Still red? Do a quick reset (press button for 5 seconds)
- Still having issues? Contact us

**Off**
- No power getting through
- Check the cable isn't damaged
- Try a different wall socket
- Make sure there's power in your property
- Cable damaged? Get in touch

### Broadband (Fibre Connection)

**Solid/Flashing Green**
- Connected or connecting to the network
- All good - check the next light

**Flashing Red/Green**
- Struggling to maintain connection
- Gently check the green fibre cable is seated properly (be gentle!)
- Unplug ONT for 10 seconds and try again
- Still flashing? Try a full reset (hold button 10-15 seconds)
- No luck? We'll need to investigate

**Off**
- Can't see the fibre cable
- Very gently check the green cable is plugged in
- If it looks fine, contact us

### Service (Network Status)

**Green**
- You're connected to the internet
- Check the last light

**Off**
- Network connection lost
- Unplug ONT for 10 seconds
- Or press reset button briefly (under 5 seconds)
- Still off? Give us a shout

### Ethernet (Router Connection)

**Solid Green**
- ONT talking to your router perfectly

**Flashing Green**
- Data flowing between ONT and router
- This is normal when you're using the internet

**Off**
- ONT can't see your router
- Check ethernet cable is in both devices
- Make sure your router is switched on
- Try a different ethernet cable if you have one
- Router won't turn on? See our setup guide

## What's Normal?

When everything's working:
- Power: Green
- Broadband: Green
- Service: Green
- Ethernet: Green (might flash when you're online)

## How to Restart

**Quick restart:**
1. Pull out the power cable
2. Count to 10
3. Plug it back in
4. Give it 2-3 minutes to wake up

**Button restart:**
1. Quick press of reset button (under 5 seconds)
2. Wait 2-3 minutes

## Full Reset (Last Resort)

Only do this if we ask you to or nothing else works:

1. Grab a paperclip
2. Hold the reset button for 10-15 seconds
3. Let go when lights start dancing
4. Wait 5 minutes for everything to come back

This wipes all settings back to how it left the factory.

## Things to Remember

- The green fibre cable is fragile - treat it gently
- Never unplug during an amber light (it's updating)
- Don't cover the ONT - it needs to breathe
- Need to move it? Talk to us first
- Keep it plugged in always

## Common ONT Models

There are a few different models depending on your install:
- Calix GP1007x (XGS-PON)
- Calix GP1100X (XGS-PON)
- Nokia XS-010X-Q (XGS-PON)
- Calix GigaPoint 801Gv2 (GPON)
- Calix GP1000g (GPON)

They all work the same way with similar lights.

## Still Stuck?

Before contacting us:
1. Note which lights are doing what (colour, flashing, off)
2. Try a restart
3. Get in touch if it's still playing up
